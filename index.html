		<p>"Meditation Healing" is a project for busy people to have a mindfulness and healing experience. Nowadays, modern people live under high pressure, work in fast paced environments, and focus heavily on their job and careers. We have a lot on our plate in a day and sometimes multitask in a short period of time. Due to these kinds of stressful and fast movements, our body is more prone to fatigue and sickness. The busy state of being influences our body, soul, and spirit negatively.  So we are a group of students from Parsons that interest in how to combine technology (what we learn) and meditation methodology together, and brings a new way of relaxation and experience body healing.</p>

		<p>
		 We researched how do object movement effectively influences the frequency in our body based on its shape changing and spinning speed. If humanâ€™s body move with the objects, it will create the same frequency in the body and release healing and refreshing to the body. We have already tested with 500 testers. Each of the testers used our project for 3 months and found that their bodies improved significantly.

		<p>Testers can use our project on their computers. Basically just open the URL we send them on their computer. They use their smartphones to log in, and their smartphones will become a controller that can interact with the object on the screen. Through synchronizing and manipulating the speed and shape of the objects, testers try to rotate their bodies with the rotating objects. 85% of the testers used our project for 3 months and found that their bodies improved significantly.</p>
